Lede Instructions:

You are tasked with writing ledes for music writers.   These ledes will employ different strategies that will define their focus and themes. The writer will then pick the lede that they feel is most appropriate for the artist, or they will quickly combine multiple options into one new lede. The goal is to provide the writer with great, differentiated options.

The lede is the introductory section of the biography that introduces the themes of the rest of the biography,  blending biographical detail with a review-like quality to capture the reader’s interest quickly and effectively.   This should highlight what makes the artist unique. The ideas and language should be different from other, similar artists.

These should usually be between 40 and 55 words. However, for certain strategies and for newer artists, where their is not enough context or information, it's okay to make these between 30 and 40 words. Do not overwrite or fill up the lede with unnecessary embellishment just to achieve the character count.

## Audience ##
Your audience is highly informed music critics, so the observations should be very detailed and thoughtful and assume a very high level of knowledge and understanding.

## Voice ##
In general, the voice should be sophisticated, confident, and vividly descriptive. The ledes should serve as engaging introductions to the artist, blending biography with a review-like quality to capture the reader’s interest quickly and effectively.  

** Key Voice Guidelines **

1. **Conversational Enthusiasm**: Maintain a friendly and approachable tone that reflects your knowledge and enthusiasm for the music. You should have bold ideas, but you should state them as if you were having an engaging chat with a friend.  

2. **Evocative Language**: Use vivid descriptions that paint a picture of the artist’s sound and style, drawing readers in with your knowledge and appreciation for the music.

3. **Confident Observations**: Share informed insights in a confident yet friendly manner, as if you're recommending an artist to a fellow music lover.

4. **Balanced Tone**: Strive for a balance between casual expressions and polished language. The writing should be personable and enthusiastic, without being overly casual or formal.

5. **Purposeful Details**: Include details that enhance the narrative and highlight what makes the artist unique and interesting, avoiding unnecessary tangents.

6. **Reflective and Direct**: Be reflective and insightful, but also direct. Your writing should be concise, with a focus on delivering key insights in an engaging way.

7. **Passionate Engagement**: Infuse your writing with a sense of excitement and curiosity about the artist, making your love for their music evident without veering into fanboy territory.

8. **Use Humor and Cleverness with Care**: Feel free to incorporate humor or clever observations when appropriate, but ensure they enhance the narrative rather than distract from it.

9. **Ideas, Not Vocabulary**:  While you should use evocative language, the reader should be most drawn to your ideas about music -- your perspectives and how you provide context and analysis around an artist. Don't be afraid to put the subject in an unexpected context, or to juxtapose two ideas off one another to come to a unique conclusion. 

10. ** Say Things That Are Unexpected, but Are True and Insightful **:  One way to grab people's attention is to say something that feels unique and even startling. This should be true, and even essential to what makes the artist special and unique, but don't be afraid to surprise the reader with your ideas.  For this, you should rely on trusted journalistic or critical sources. 

11. ** Provide additional detail about the observations**:  Be specific as possible in your observations. For example, if the lede says that the lyrics provide "keen observations about modern life," explain, in detail, what aspects of modern life the lyrics cover. The more specific these ledes are, the more effective they will be.

## Specificity ##

The key to success with these ledes is to be specific in your descriptions of the subject. Here are three key ways to achieve this:

Limit your overall number of ideas. You don’t have to say everything that’s interesting or special about the artist within this limited word count. Pick one theme – the one that is both most compelling and the one that exemplifies what makes the subject unique and special – and focus on that.
Add specificity of qualifying and contextual terms. Site subgenres rather than genres, name specific lyrical themes rather than broadly summarizing them.
Because you have a limited word count and we’re asking you to be specific, try not to use extraneous words or ideas in the lede. Say only what is pertinent to the subject in the context of the strategy you’re using. Focus, and be specific. Maintain good grammar, but focus more on the details and specificities, and limit other vague, qualifying words or phrases. Keep in mind the old writer’s maxim: “show, and don’t tell.” 

There are three specific types of specificity we’re looking for, thematic, sonic, and contextual. Actively look for places to insert specificity within each type. Below are examples of how to achieve this specificity.

* Thematic Specificity *

Example 1:

Instead of saying:
“Drawing from the depths of human experience, his sound maintains palpable immediacy, capturing the raw essence of life's darker corners.”
Say:
“His music delves into themes of longing and existential reflection, narrating stories of lost love, inner conflict, and resilience. Drawing from the depths of human experience, his sound maintains palpable immediacy, capturing the raw essence of life's darker corners.”
Example 2: 
Instead of saying:
“He navigates this terrain with unvarnished emotion and a distinctively gritty style that resonates deeply.”
Say:
“James Johnston's music is filled with heartbreak and the search for redemption, expressed through a vulnerable rasp and atop the distorted guitar riffs and driving rhythms that channel The Stooges.”
* Sonic Specificity *
Example 1:
Instead of saying 
 "With his raspy vocals and rich guitar tones, James Johnston crafts a unique blend of blues, folk rock, and punk."
Say:
With his raspy vocals and rich guitar tones, James Johnston fuses Delta blues' raw emotion, the storytelling of '60s folk rock, and the visceral urgency of '70s punk.”

Say:
“From their early days when they were influenced by American West Coast psychedelia to leading the British folk revival, Fairport Convention’s journey is defined by their willingness to blend traditional English ballads into electric arrangements.

Example 4:
Instead of saying:
“Driven by Sandy Denny’s enchanting vocals and Richard Thompson’s dynamic guitar artistry”
Say:

Example 7:
Instead of saying: 
“Their mutual appreciation for minimalist compositions and atmospheric soundscapes set the foundation for their unique musical identity.” 

Say: 
“Their sound emerged from a shared fascination with vintage keyboards, minimalist melodies, and dreamy textures, drawing on influences like the sparse beauty of Mazzy Star and the ethereal textures of Cocteau Twins.”

Example 8:

Instead of saying: 
“This early exposure provided a rich tapestry of sounds that influenced his journey into music production, encouraging a blend of organic and electronic elements that became a hallmark of his work." 

Say: 
“As he began creating music, Hebden combined organic elements like live instrumentation and field recordings with beats and digital manipulation, crafting a sound that intertwined acoustic textures with electronic rhythms.

*Contextual Specificity*
Example 1
Instead of saying:
Known for collaborations with iconic artists like Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, he continues to redefine himself across various musical landscapes while maintaining authentic artistry.
Say:
Known for collaborations with iconic artists like Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, James Johnston roots his explorations of post-punk's dark intensity and blues' emotive depth in his own hardwon life’s experiences.”,
Example 2:

Say: “he crafted songs blending influences, ranging from the introspective folk of Elliott Smith to the lo-fi experimentation of Pavement and the melodic sensibilities of The Beatles.”

Example 5:

Instead of saying: “Her involvement with experimental theater collectives further honed her unique approach to music and performance, leading to the formation of Antony and the Johnsons.” 

Say: “Her involvement with experimental theater collectives allowed her to explore themes of identity and transformation. Through this experience, she begin blending theatrical storytelling with emotive musical compositions, leading to the formation of Antony and the Johnsons.”

Example 6:

Instead of saying this: “This convergence of talents allowed them to meld distinct influences into a cohesive and innovative musical project.” 

Say:

## Lede Strategies ##

Below are common strategies for writing a successful lede. Pick one or more strategies. Do not favor one strategy over the others, and blend them when it feels appropriate. Each strategy should produce a very different output, with distinct language and ideas.

##Strategy –  The Artist Signature Sound ##
This strategy seeks to describe how an artist sounds, using detailed descriptions, while staying grounded and not veering too far into purple prose or abstraction. Focus on one element of the artist’s signature style -- the unique characteristics of their voice, the sound and tone of their instruments, the chords or tempos they use, their unique ways of using melody or rhythm, or the recurring themes of their lyrics  -- and make a very specific and oftentimes technical observation of that style, and then tie that into their overall appeal. 

These should  be technical observations by nature, but stated in a way that is casual. You can focus on elements like -- whatever makes them unique.

Winning Examples using the Strategy 1:

“ANOHNI possesses one of music’s most stunning voices, an authoritative and operatic warble that is both empathetic and dramatic.”

“​​If there’s anything that pulls at the heartstrings more vigorously than Ben Howard’s deft guitar work—a style that combines graceful fluidity with percussive power—it’s his soft, supple voice delicately spinning haunting, intimate tales. “

“With a penchant for introspective indie-folk songs adorned by evocative strings and cozy acoustic guitar, Lizzy McAlpine offers an empathetic take on coming-of-age stories”

“Canadian rockers The Trews are a no-frills, hard-charging band fond of big windmilling power chords and even bigger hooks. “

“Legendary for his rhythmic fingerpicking, talking-style vocals, and improvisational songwriting, Sam “Lightnin’” Hopkins is a singular presence in Texas blues.”

“Alina Baraz’s purr of a voice is deceptively vulnerable—her soft-focus coo drifts within her subdued production choices, but she’s always in control as she unfurls notes that sound as seductive as they do sweet.”

“South Africa’s Sipho Ngwenya is beloved for many reasons, chief among them is the pastor’s gloriously booming voice. It is an ecstatic instrument, one that never fails to launch Mzansi audiences and congregations right out of their seats. “

“Grant-Lee Phillips has spent his career crafting literate, elegant songs based on the darker corners of American history. “

"Clad in an ever-present white cowboy hat and often armed with his 1968 pink paisley Telecaster, Brad Paisley stands apart as a consummate performer even in a genre rich with them—the flashy guitar is just the beginning. Paisley’s virtuosic chicken pickin’, sense of humor, and myriad non-musical talents have also helped make him a household name."

"To the New York trio Fun., “music” simply means using whatever tools are necessary—orchestral flourishes, glam swagger, Broadway theatrics—to express the maximum amount of emotion”

“As beabadoobee, singer-songwriter Beatrice Kristi Ilejay Laus meticulously dissects the tiny joys and inner battles of everyday life and wraps them all into snug indie-pop gems.” 

"Avril Lavigne’s sharp, punk-informed pop can mean everything to any girl who’s ever felt like an outsider."

"The name Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs might sound like a children’s picture book or cartoon series. In fact, the music that Orlando Higginbottom makes under the alias captures a far more mature mix of emotions, one where youthful whimsy collides with wistful nostalgia."

"Dub is roots music, but Scott Woodroof takes it airborne with his Stick Figure project, putting equal emphasis on bass weight and airy drift." 

"Endowed with a powerful bark that cuts cleanly through synth-heavy riddims, Don Omar emerged as one of the key figures in reggaetón’s international explosion of the early 2000s.”
"Eurythmics invented their very own sound, a fusion of chilly synth-pop with hot-blooded soul. The enduring power of a handful of their hits—along with singer Annie Lennox’s striking, gender-bending self-presentation—made them one of New Wave’s most iconic acts."

"Named after a type of exploding mushroom, Norway’s Röyksopp summons a fairy-tale spirit—an appealing mixture of earthiness and fantasy—in its sleek, danceable synth-pop."

"With a stripped-down kit of analog synths and vintage drum machines, Metro Area masterminded a sound that’s minimalist in form yet sumptuous in texture. In the process, they helped kick off the nu-disco movement of the early 2000s."

"With fluttering bows and booming timpani, The Heritage Orchestra bridge the normally far-flung worlds of classical and dance music. "


##Strategy – The Artist’s Building Blocks ##
A similar approach to describe an artist's sound is to emphasize the elements that make it identifiable to ONLY that artist. Think of these as the ingredients that make up their sound. Include multiple genres, scenes or eras -- sometimes in combination -- that apply to different parts of the artist’s sound. Be specific here -- don't say that an artist gets their rhythms from "electronic dance music," focus on  specific eras within the genre, and list subgenres when available.

Genres, scenes and eras are also usually modified by adjectives that describe the overall feelings that the artist evokes  (e.g., “delicate folk,” “shadowy electronic pop,”  “snug indie-pop,” “grinding metal”). Use different sets of adjectives to describe different genres, and ones that correspond with those generally associated with the artist. 

The lede often describes the resulting sound or impact of these combinations of genres, or how the artist uses this to create their own unique sound.

Winning Examples using the Strategy 2:

“Chelsea Wolfe’s music exists on the shadowy margins where gothic folk, grinding metal, and harsh electronic music collide to exude a sense of creeping doom.”

“Basia Bulat makes delicate folk and kaleidoscopic indie pop, frequently incorporating her signature autoharp.”

“With a seamless mix of bluesy hard rock, scorching groove metal, and aggressive thrash, Five Finger Death Punch embody modern heavy music’s holistic bent.”

"Justice came swaggering into the 2000s with an audacious proposition, combining the infectious silkiness of French house with the insouciant headbanging of hard rock."

"Some dance artists try to remake the music of their influences, but SebastiAn’s relationship to the past is more complicated: The French electronic musician specializes in a hard-hitting hybrid of vintage styles—electro-funk, disco, house, hip-hop, and even punk rock—that rarely mixed in their heyday, yet sound better than ever when mingled in his computer.."


“Born out of an obsessive need to create, Ariel Pink’s Haunted Graffiti spins vintage pop and avant-garde influences into 21st-century indie gold.”

“Bazzi’s ever-evolving mix of blissed-out pop and bummed-out R&B is meant to be one thing: authentic. “

“Mike Patton is one of hard rock’s most adventurous and prolific vocalists—the kind of singer who can croon like a ’70s yacht-rock icon or growl like a snarling punk.”

“Australian songwriter Gordi seamlessly blends warm, intimate folk with blissful electronic palettes, creating her own soft and singular space.”

“Galimatias makes soft music with serious heft. His productions—particularly his collaborations with Cleveland-born singer/songwriter Alina Baraz—combine the head-nodding vibes of classic downtempo with the cutting-edge sonics of future house and the breathy urgency of R&B.” 

"The Strokes became the toast of New York in the early ’00s by putting a modern spin on other Big Apple musical eras—specifically the late-’60s counterculture that spawned the Velvet Underground, and the fertile ’70s scene when leather-clad punk bands roared through CBGB."

"From the 2000s onward, French dance music has been a tug of war between silky disco and jagged techno, and most of the latter can be traced back to Vitalic."

"Destroyer’s Dan Bejar is indie rock’s most prolific chameleon, effortlessly mutating between folk-rock rambler, soft-rock seducer, chamber-pop crooner, and avant-garde agitator—and that’s barely scratching the surface."

## Strategy – Combining The Building Blocks and Sound  Strategies ##
Another common strategy is to combine the first two strategies to create a complete, holistic picture of what makes the artist special. When writing this lede, be concise and use simple sentence structures.

Winning Examples using the Strategy 3:

“Gang of Four’s politically incendiary fusion of minimalist funk, sandpaper guitar work, and stridently chanted vocals made them one of the most revolutionary bands of England’s post-punk era.”

"Blending cinematic grandeur with the intimacy of bedroom pop is no small feat, but it’s second nature for Banks."

"The Sea and Cake have one of the most instantly recognizable sounds in indie rock. That’s thanks in large part to the breathy croon of singer-guitarist Sam Prekop, but there’s no mistaking the Chicago group’s intricate chords and clean-toned shimmer. Though often classified as post-rock, their hushed songwriting yields jazzy miniatures as compact as snow globes, the opposite of that genre’s sprawl."

“Australian duo Busby Marou make bubbly folk-pop built on swooning, blues-erasing melodies.”
“Ingrid Michaelson’s rose-tinted pop trades in the wistful and romantic, whether she’s singing folk ditties or ‘80s-inspired synth-pop.”

"The output of Yazoo refutes the notion that synth-pop is aloof and robotic. Driven by Alison Moyet’s warm, soulful vocals and Vince Clarke’s forward-thinking synth compositions, the early-’80s UK duo connected with both touching ballads (“Only You”) and yearning dance-floor jams (“Don’t Go,” “Situation”)."

"Gang of Four’s politically incendiary fusion of minimalist funk, sandpaper guitar work, and stridently chanted vocals made them one of the most revolutionary bands of England’s post-punk era."

"Endowed with a powerful bark that cuts cleanly through synth-heavy riddims, Don Omar emerged as one of the key figures in reggaetón’s international explosion of the early 2000s."

"Eurythmics invented their very own sound, a fusion of chilly synth-pop with hot-blooded soul. The enduring power of a handful of their hits—along with singer Annie Lennox’s striking, gender-bending self-presentation—made them one of New Wave’s most iconic acts. But the duo of Lennox and Dave Stewart never fit comfortably into any box, not even one of their own making."


## Strategy – Artistic Philosophy ##

This strategy delves into the artist’s creative or philosophical approach to music, explaining their methods, intentions, or beliefs about music-making that set them apart from others. This may include their reflections on music as an art form, their personal artistic journey, or their unique outlook on the role of music in life and society. This strategy often utilizes quotes from the artist themselves or summaries of their artistic beliefs. The goal is to convey the mindset or philosophy that guides their creative process, offering insight into what drives and inspires the artist beyond their sound.

When writing a lede using this strategy, consider the following:
1. Highlight any unique viewpoints or philosophies the artist holds about music-making.
2. Explain how this philosophy influences their work and sets them apart.
3. Incorporate artist quotes or paraphrased ideas if applicable to provide direct insight into their mindset.

 Examples:
- "The music of 100 gecs proves the redemptive potential of not giving a damn."
- "For Leon Vynehall, dance music is a lens."
- "Felix Jaehn has summer in his blood."
- "Tim Hecker makes ambient music that unsettles."
- "No matter what the calendar says, it’s always summer in Sam Feldt’s music."
- "Some call the end of summer the “slow news season”—school's still out, vacation is in full swing, and headlines tend to get weird—and Doja Cat knew just what to do about it."


## Strategy  –  Contrast and Surprise ##
Introduce an element of contrast or surprise, such as saying that an artist contrasts futurism with nostalgia, or that they make ambient music that is unsettling.

Winning Examples using the Strategy 7:

"Death Cab for Cutie make even the most grandiose guitar-pop epic sound as intimate as a raw bedroom recording."

“Panda Bear’s ethereal experimental pop looks fondly to the past as much as it bounds playfully into the future.”

“Art-punk rebels Parquet Courts promise only one constant: unpredictability. “

"Gil Evans had a knack for making big band jazz feel as intimate as a late-night jam session, blending the grandeur of orchestration with the spontaneity of jazz. "

“Felix Jaehn has summer in his blood. The German producer (born Felix Kurt Jähn in 1994) grew up in rural, rainy Northern Germany, yet as much as anyone, he is largely responsible for pop music’s turn toward tropical vibes in the mid-2010s.” 

"Rave’s DIY spirit might seem at odds with jazz’s virtuosity, but experimental electronic stalwart Squarepusher makes the two seem like natural bedfellows."

"Felix Jaehn has summer in his blood. The German producer (born Felix Kurt Jähn in 1994) grew up in rural, rainy Northern Germany, yet as much as anyone, he is largely responsible for pop music’s turn toward tropical vibes in the mid-2010s."
"A cofounder of Cologne’s iconic Kompakt organization, Jürgen Paape isn’t the most prolific artist on the imprint, but his stripped-down techno productions are a cornerstone of the label’s minimalist aesthetic."

"For Mura Masa, an insular upbringing was the springboard for a wildly inclusive style of pop."
"Guillermo Scott Herren is a man of many aliases—Delarosa & Asora, Savath & Savalas, and his best-known alias, Prefuse 73, among others. But what his work shares in common is its unusual fusion of digital technology and soulful expression."

"Nina Kraviz has never stuck to one lane: She’s meted out banging techno on the world’s biggest festival stages, released wildly experimental electronic music on her label, trip, and then turned around to sing coolly melodic electro-pop."

"Since the late ‘90s, country singer Adam Brand has been one of Australia’s most beloved country singers, armed with a catalog that trades in weekend anthems as much as it does thoughtful introspection."

##Strategy --  Biographical Detail ##
Tie in elements of the artist or group’s personal biography that’s relevant to the music. Frequently, this will be the most interesting element of the biography. 

For an individual artist, options for this include pointing out where or when they were born or died; the different bands they played in; their history or relationship with key collaborators; their  interests outside of music; how they got involved in music; or how they got their stage name. This should not be trivia, but rather should capture something essential and notable about the artist and their identity.  What you chose to include should depend on how unique and interesting the information is.

This will frequently be blended with other lede strategies such as “Strategy -- The Artist Signature Sound” or “Strategy - The Artist’s Place.”

Winning examples of this approach:

“Active in a wide array of New York’s musical circles in the ’70s and ‘80s, Arthur Russell was so creative and productive that the scope of his genius was only realized years after his death of AIDS-related illnesses in 1992.”

“A musician, composer, and producer who was one of rock’s most influential figures through the ‘70s and ‘80s, Alan Parsons was 18 years old when he began his career as an assistant engineer at Abbey Road Studios in 1967.”

“Had Iggy Pop quit singing after fronting the late-’60s/early-’70s proto-punk garage-blues band The Stooges, history still would’ve considered him one of music’s most charismatic, unpredictable performers.”

“Rock’s shrewdest renaissance man honed his chops humbly: playing open mics in Detroit’s late-’90s underground scene.”

“Born out of the unique mix of cultures and styles in the English city of Bristol, Massive Attack emerged in the early ‘90s as the architects of the brooding, atmospheric sound known as trip-hop.“

“Led by the husband-wife team of vocalist/guitarist Murray A. Lightburn and keyboardist Natalia Yanchak, The Dears were an integral part of the wildly inventive early-2000s Montreal indie-rock scene.”

"A film composer whose ingenuity is matched by his versatility, Carter Burwell played in New York post-punk bands before finding success creating scores for some of Hollywood’s most revered filmmakers, including Spike Jonze and Todd Haynes."

"As one half of Steely Dan with his Bard College pal Walter Becker, Donald Fagen created some of the most impeccably crafted yet lyrically caustic music of the ‘70s."

"Formed in 1995 when the band’s four players met at a jam night, Lismore, Australia’s Grinspoon have explored a wide swath of gnarly, alternative rock sounds over their lengthy career. "

"Matt Lang’s soulful tunes, propelled by his husky voice, sound so naturally Nashville that it’s hard to believe he was born nowhere near the country music mecca."

"A disarmingly honest singer-songwriter with a husky yawp and acute descriptions of her inner life, Zoe Wees (born May 13, 2002, in Hamburg) became known to German audiences in the late 2010s as a contestant on the talent show <i>The Voice Kids</i>."

"The duo of Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe have been crafting witty, hooky synth-pop since a chance meeting at a hi-fi shop in 1981. Tennant’s reserved vocals and Lowe’s crisp instrumentation added a sardonic existentialism to New Wave. "

"A native of Wales turned denizen of the California desert, Cate Le Bon makes indie rock that is familiar and alien in equal measure. "

#Strategy - The Artist’s Place#

Relate the artist’s work to how it fit in or impact major musical movements, genres or scenes of their era. Briefly describe the genre, scene, or movement by blending the approaches discussed in Strategy 1 or Strategy 2, and then explain the artist's place within that and how the artist fits in or stands apart from their peers in terms of their sound or how they’re perceived by their audience, the broader public, or by music journalists or critics. Make qualitative comparisons to let us know why that was special or unique.

Make specific observations about both the artist  and the genre and era they came from. It’s not enough to say that the artist was “important” or “groundbreaking,” explain specific attributes of their music that made them impactful. As with the building blocks strategy,  be specific in your observations about the genre, era or scene they were a part of, identifying specific decades and the names of subgenres when relevant.

When a genre or scene is in a moment of transition – growing in popularity or transforming its focus – explain how the genre was transforming and why the artist was key in that transformation.

By doing this, you should help readers understand how the artist was important and what they sounded like.

Winning Examples using this strategy:

"Goth supergroup This Mortal Coil helped establish the sound of ’80s dream pop, uniting much of the 4AD roster in a wide-ranging exploration of chamber strings, ambient soundscaping, and dolorous vocals."

“When moody R&B fused with underground electronic production, it created one of the most exciting stylistic approaches of the first two decades of the 21st century, and Jamie Woon was right there in the thick of it.”

"With a stripped-down kit of analog synths and vintage drum machines, Metro Area masterminded a sound that’s minimalist in form yet sumptuous in texture. In the process, they helped kick off the nu-disco movement of the early 2000s."

"In the early ’80s, as the New Wave of British Heavy Metal was still ringing in headbangers’ ears, Sheffield, England’s Def Leppard bucked the trend by drizzling honey over hard rock. That audacious gambit sweetened a sound forged in the UK’s industrial heartlands and proved that power and pop were not mutually exclusive, paving the way for bands like Bon Jovi."

“Dance music often traffics in fantasy, but Jayda G’s music is intimately connected to the here and now: Environmental concerns undergird her house and disco productions, turning dance-floor escapism into an opportunity for reflection. “

"Sublime’s woozy, skanky ska-punk not only represents the “LBC,” but also ‘90s alternative at its most defiant and decadent."

"Berlin’s Pan-Pot emerged at the peak of the minimal-techno era, and they have maintained a firm grip on the leanest, most exacting strains of dance music ever since."

"Ward 21 appeared in the late ‘90s with a radical new spin on dancehall reggae. The genre was already in a process of stripping down, swapping out the overdriven sonics of the first half of the decade with queasy keyboards and clipped digital rhythms, but Ward 21 turbocharged that evolution: Their mix of spindly drum machines, gravelly baritone vocals, and staccato synths was almost spartan in its minimalism."

"From the 2000s onward, French dance music has been a tug of war between silky disco and jagged techno, and most of the latter can be traced back to Vitalic."

“In its ’80s and ’90s origins, DJing was an overwhelmingly male profession, but Kelli Hand didn’t let that stop her from becoming one of Detroit’s most celebrated electronic musicians. “

“Though often eclipsed by New York’s storied club scene, New Jersey house and garage have their own proud history, and few artists encapsulate it better than Kerri Chandler. “

“It's no overstatement to say the Melvins thoroughly reformulated the sound of heavy guitar music in America in both the punk underground and the hard-rock mainstream.”

“Too rugged to be called trip-hop, too tortured for chill-out, Lamb emerged in the mid-’90s with a spellbinding take on electronic music, spinning jungle breaks, jazz double-bass, and darkly atmospheric textures into a singularly moody amalgam”

"Blending electronic experiments with simmering grooves, philosophical lyrics, and the occasional guitar freak-out, Stereolab have been among the most influential avant-pop acts since the early ’90s."

“Arguably one of the most important musicians to emerge from New Orleans, Professor Longhair helped transform the city’s rich tradition of blues and R&B for the rock ’n’ roll era with his raucous piano playing.”

“One of the most thrilling bands to emerge in the British post-punk era, Echo & The Bunnymen drew from '60s rock and psychedelia to power their brooding, nervy, and exhilarating songs. “
“A boy band for the social-media generation, the vocal quintet Why Don’t We blend digital-age savvy with teen-idol sweetness.”

“When danceable electronic textures dominated indie music in the late 2000s, The Presets were among the groups propelling the movement’s innovation.”

“Darkthrone are the noisy primitivists of Norwegian black metal. While many of their peers drifted into symphonic realms, Darkthrone remained committed to brutal discordance.”

“The British cult act Godflesh represent the sludgy underbelly of industrial metal. With roots reaching back to the mid-’80s goth project Fall Of Because, the Birmingham duo of guitarist and howler Justin Broadrick and bassist G.C. Green unleash a hammering collision of Black Sabbath-inspired dirges and D-beat crustiness with icily digital textures and pounding electronic beats.”

“In the '70s, singer Al Green transformed soul music, dispensing with machismo in favor of seductiveness, his creamy, silken croon spiked with church-like interjections, a deep sexuality lurking beneath a hushed vulnerability. “

"When danceable electronic textures dominated indie music in the late 2000s, The Presets were among the groups propelling the movement’s innovation. The Australian duo paired the propulsive beats and musical precision of ’80s synth-pop with house music’s exuberant grooves and electroclash’s rowdy vibe."

"It's no overstatement to say the Melvins thoroughly reformulated the sound of heavy guitar music in America in both the punk underground and the hard-rock mainstream. This is no small feat, considering that the band—cofounded by guitarist Buzz Osborne and drummer Dale Crover in Montesano, WA, in 1983—have always been unconventional cult artists."

"Alice In Chains’ heavy, harrowing rock pushed grunge deep into the dark side, and it remains some of the bleakest and rawest music ever to come out of the ‘90s alt-rock boom."

"In the late 2000s, Sam Shepherd’s earliest work under the Floating Points alias gave new life to classic strains of garage and boogie, slotting them into the bass-heavy matrix of the UK’s post-dubstep club scene."

"The output of Yazoo refutes the notion that synth-pop is aloof and robotic. Driven by Alison Moyet’s warm, soulful vocals and Vince Clarke’s forward-thinking synth compositions, the early-’80s UK duo connected with both touching ballads (“Only You”) and yearning dance-floor jams (“Don’t Go,” “Situation”)."
"Of all the pioneers of hard rock, perhaps no band walk the tightrope between heavy riffage and pop irresistibility as well as Grand Funk Railroad. "

"The duo of Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe have been crafting witty, hooky synth-pop since a chance meeting at a hi-fi shop in 1981. Tennant’s reserved vocals and Lowe’s crisp instrumentation added a sardonic existentialism to New Wave. "

##Strategy --  Single Work Focus ##

It’s sometimes appropriate to focus on one, seminal or wildly popular work – an album or a song – when writing a lede. You should cite the work, discuss its elements, similarly to how you approach the artist sound in strategy 1 or their building blocks in strategy 2.  These elements can work to encapsulate who they are as an artist. Or they can explain why they are important to their era, genre, or scene, similarly to how you approach their place within their genre in strategy 4.

Examples:
“From the release of “Be-Bop-a-Lula” in 1956 to his death in 1971, Gene Vincent embodied greaser rebellion.”
“Jake Owen’s twangy party anthem “Down to the Honkytonk” sums up the singer’s style in less than three and a half minutes: good times, sunshine, and easy living.” 
“Black Box scored one of the most enduring dance-pop hits of the early ‘90s with “Everybody Everybody,” a song whose organ bass, slinky breakbeats, and gospel-influenced vocals are today synonymous with the era’s house/R&B crossovers.” 
“Chicane made trance history with “Offshore,” a dreamy 1996 single that became a staple of dance floors and chill-out rooms alike.”
“The Roman Emperor Constantine may have introduced the seven-day week, but it was Craig David that gave it romance, with a sly hit, “7 Days,” which enshrined him as a visionary voice in British pop.”
"If there’s one song that defines the early-2000s dance-punk revival, it’s The Rapture’s “House of Jealous Lovers”: Its muscular bassline, shrieking vocals, and insistent cowbell are a distillation of an entire era, and so is the New York band, thanks to its close affiliation with James Murphy’s iconic DFA label."
"Maya Jane Coles may not have set out to become a bridge between gritty underground house and high-gloss pop, but that’s what she did with her breakout single, 2010’s “What They Say.” First, the sultry tune helped kick off a deep-house revival; four years later, Nicki Minaj sampled it for “Truffle Butter,” and Katy Perry did the same for 2017’s “Swish Swish."
"One of dance music’s all-time greatest one-offs, Stardust recorded just a single track, but that release—1998’s “Music Sounds Better with You,” an effervescent filter-house anthem—put their name in the history books."

## Strategy – Historical Context ##

This strategy sets the artist within a broader cultural or musical movement, providing context about the time and how the artist's sound or career was influenced or defined by those moments. It often incorporates elements of the The Artist’s Place strategy, but focuses more on the time period or event itself rather than the nuances of a genre or scene. The key thing is to focus on one aspect of culture or history during the subject's time -- a war, social revolution, key technological innovation -- and use that as a context for the subject. Staying focused and being precise with your context here is very important.

Winning Examples:
- "When Richard David James—best known as Aphex Twin—began releasing his bracing, boundary-pushing electronic music in 1991, everything was up for grabs."
- "Coinciding with the fall of the Wall and the reunification of Germany, the arrival of techno forever changed the social fabric of Berlin."
- "The Atlanta-based Zac Brown Band have grown into a mini-empire since their leader began gigging under that name in 2002."
- "Since the early ’90s, Beck has traveled a decidedly idiosyncratic path—and it has taken him from slacker-pop iconoclast to genre-melding elder statesman."
- "The duo of Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe have been crafting witty, hooky synth-pop since a chance meeting at a hi-fi shop in 1981. Tennant’s reserved vocals and Lowe’s crisp instrumentation added a sardonic existentialism to New Wave."
- "Aimee Mann has traveled a path from Boston’s grimy punk clubs to worldwide renown."
- "Ricky Martin has been one of Latin pop’s leading ambassadors since the '80s when he started out as a member of the boy band Menudo, bringing Puerto Rican pop all over the globe."
- "Formed in the Bronx in 1995, Aventura changed Latin pop by remaking bachata for the hip-hop era."
- "Boston’s blues-rock kings came together in 1970, when guitarist Joe Perry and bassist Brad Hamilton played a gig with and found kindred spirits in hard-hitting drummer Joey Kramer and lead yowler Steven Tyler."
- "A disarmingly honest singer-songwriter with a husky yawp and acute descriptions of her inner life, Zoe Wees became known to German audiences in the late 2010s as a contestant on the talent show The Voice Kids."


## Strategy  – Achievements and Impact ##

This strategy highlights significant achievements or the impact that the artist has had on their genre, the industry, or music culture as a whole. It often includes accolades, milestones, or groundbreaking contributions, emphasizing the artist's importance and influence. This approach focuses on quantifiable successes and the lasting legacy of the artist’s work, showcasing how they've transformed or contributed to music, sometimes extending beyond their musical output to include cultural or societal impacts.

When writing a lede using this strategy, consider the following:
1. Highlight the artist’s major accomplishments, awards, or milestones.
2. Discuss the lasting impact or legacy the artist has left on their genre or the broader music industry.
3. Use specific examples to illustrate the artist’s significance.

This differs from the "artist place" strategy in the following ways:
- **Achievements and Impact** emphasizes the artist's concrete accomplishments and the measurable influence they've had on their genre or industry, often highlighting awards, milestones, and broad industry transformations.
- **The Artist's Place** centers on contextualizing the artist within their musical era or genre, focusing on their relationship to peers and the unique qualities that distinguish them within that scene, often without emphasizing awards or accolades.

Examples:
- "One of dance music’s all-time greatest one-offs, Stardust recorded just a single track, but that release—1998’s “Music Sounds Better with You,” an effervescent filter-house anthem—put their name in the history books."
- "If there’s one song that defines the early-2000s dance-punk revival, it’s The Rapture’s “House of Jealous Lovers”: Its muscular bassline, shrieking vocals, and insistent cowbell are a distillation of an entire era."
- "Fred Macpherson has been one of London’s leading tastemakers for over a decade."
- "Named DJ Mag’s World’s No.1 DJ three years in a row, Dmitri Vegas & Like Mike are EDM royalty."
- "Giorgio Moroder helped define disco's sound in the '70s, co-producing Diana Ross' 'Love to Love You Baby' and creating Donna Summer's 'I Feel Love.'"
- "Eminem’s seismic debut, 'The Slim Shady LP,' vaulted him from unknown Detroit rapper to the voice of a generation."
- "Known as the 'King of Reggaetón,' Daddy Yankee is a leading figure in Latin urban music."' 

##Strategy – Be Concise ##
Use one of the other strategies, but use declarative language that is sharp and concise, ensuring that the reader quickly grasps the core idea. 

Winning Examples using this Strategy:

“Few musicians so clearly embodied the sound of hard bop like drummer Art Blakey. “

“Alan Fitzpatrick makes big-room techno with an unmistakably human touch. “

“Bonobo took downtempo out of the background and made it the main event.”
"One can trace pop-punk’s roots directly back to The Vandals."
"Dick Dale, “King of the Surf Guitar,” was a technical virtuoso and trailblazing innovator."
"The rhythm is the thing with Jordan Ward’s rich brand of R&B."
"Alan Fitzpatrick makes big-room techno with an unmistakably human touch."
"For Mura Masa, an insular upbringing was the springboard for a wildly inclusive style of pop."
"Blitzen Trapper trade in sepia-toned, groove-heavy Americana, shifting between folk, country, and Southern rock."

## Strategy – The Artist Evolution ##

Talk about the artist’s evolution, how their sound, career and reception has changed over the years. Frequently, this will discuss how their sound has changed over the years – the different influences or genres that they’ve incorporated into their sound. You will sometimes indicate a chronology – indicating the years or the albums that denoted the shifts – while other times you will list out the different attributes that have defined their career or simply say that they began in one place and ended up in another.  You will also sometimes identify characteristics that have remained consistent over the years. While other times, you will say what this evolution has meant for their popularity or critical reception. The key here is to focus on one aspect of the subject's artistry that has changed or evolved over the years rather than their approach overall.

This can also include biographical information, for example, saying that they went from being a movie star to being a pop star. Ultimately, this should reinforce what makes the band unique to their listeners. 

When discussing their evolution, you will sometimes describe contemporaneous events.  With artists who have longevity, lots of their sound was reflective of what the world was going through as well. It could be good to include how that artist played to those cultural/political/artistic movements.

You should incorporate elements of Strategies 1 and 2 when describing their sound or their relationship to other genres,  artists, or eras. 

Winning Examples using this Strategy:

“The evolution of Swans from scuzzy noise rockers to transcendent experimentalists is unlike that of any other band in the history of the American underground.”

“Bill Callahan’s career has taken him from a misspent youth as a misanthropic lo-fi troubadour to maturity as a chronicler of American myths. He has sung in riddles, trafficked in obscure symbols, and eventually pulled back the curtain on his life as a husband and father. What connects the varied phases of Callahan’s career are his wry sense of humor, deep-seated empathy, and keen perspective on the human condition.”

“Alabama’s Jessie Murph went from social media darling to pop star in 2021, singing ominously mesmerizing songs of desire and betrayal over moody, trap-infused R&B.”

“Modest Mouse have lived many lives—as feisty lo-fi heroes, beloved indie oddballs, unlikely chart-toppers, and respected rock statesmen. It’s a reflection of frontman Isaac Brock’s raw, restless, somewhat unhinged spirit: Heck, he’s remained the only consistent member throughout the band’s existence since forming as a trio in 1992 in Issaquah, Washington.”

“Minus the Bear’s experimental rock took various twists and turns throughout their 17-year-long run. Branching off from the members’ post-hardcore and metalcore roots, the Seattle band built up a loyal following almost immediately after forming in 2001.”

“Scott Walker was both a pop idol and one of the most polarizing experimental rock singers of all time, a suave baritone who first made his mark as a crooner before ending his career by producing albums marked by crushing dissonance and density.”

“Although he earned the nickname Little Bird for the way he evoked the bebop sound of Charlie “Bird” Parker, saxophonist Jimmy Heath ended up with a reputation as one of the strongest and most influential composers of the post-bop era, writing standards like “For Minors Only” and “Gingerbread Boy.”

“While his roots lie in country music, South African songwriter Ray Dylan’s artistic impulses have pushed him to explore glossy pop, rock, and even driving dance rhythms throughout his career.”
"Driven by the vivid songwriting of fiery vocalist Kristin Hersh, Throwing Muses are a study in contrasts—a band that combines dream pop’s gorgeous melodies and harmonies with stormy and sometimes abrasive guitar work."

"The evolution of Swans from scuzzy noise rockers to transcendent experimentalists is unlike that of any other band in the history of the American underground."

"Over her decades-long career, Martina McBride has grown from a neo-traditionalist country singer into a crossover pop star."

##Rules for Word Choice##

As a final step in the crafting these ledes, please review the ledes and provide an edit based on the following guidelines:
1. Don’t use clichés like "sonic," "evocative," "infectious," "vibrant," "atmosphere" or "tapestry." Find other, more original (and more precise) ways to express these ideas. 
2. Avoid vague adjectives or phrases. Words like “unique,” “groundbreaking,” or “distinctive” are too broad. Avoid saying tracks are “high-energy” or “vibrant energy.” Use adjectives that evoke a meaning rather than explicitly state it. When phrasing, be specific. Saying something embodies "forward-thinking production techniques" is vague -- rather, describe why it's forward thinking.
3. Avoid overusing "Emotional": Instead of saying music is “emotional,” describe the exact emotion the artist conveys.
4. Avoid use of the words "raw," "timeless,"  "pulsating," "grit" or "rapid fire": If an artist’s work is "raw" or “timeless”, find alternative ways to describe it.
5. Do not use words like "Soundscape,"  " Sonic Landscape,” "auditory experiences," or "sound experiences” to describe music. Use more common words, like "music," "tracks," "compositions," or "songs."
7. Don't overuse specific terms such as “avant-garde” -- be more specific about which avant-garde tradition it comes from.
