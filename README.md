## What in the ... ?

Thirdeyes is an exploration into the levergaging of fine-tuned LLMs for the service of writing editorial content. The goal is to fine tune a model to get it to speak with a specific editorial style/tone of voice.

My client works with different platforms that each have their very specific styles of presenting their information. Thirdeyes should allow the client to select a platform, then the style of an individual writer working for the client. The output will be copy written in the style of a specific individual tailored for a specific platform.

# Working w Large Language Models

The app is currently wired up with gpt-4-1106-preview. Though I'm rapidly testing other models, so YMMV ... your model may vary. heh.

The fine-tuning job was based on a dataset provided by the client. Concurrently I'm actively exploring fine-tuning for a public version of the app using the [18,393 Pitchfork Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nolanbconaway/pitchfork-data) dataset on Kaggle.

# Vercel AI SDK

The app is built on top of the [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs).

I scaffolded out the app using the [AWS Bedrock v Vercel AI documentation](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/guides/providers/aws-bedrock). It's a quick single page document, but gave me enough to get started.

## Vercel KV

>Vercel KV is a durable Redis database that enables you to store and retrieve JSON data.

### Saved Chats

It must be pointed out that the example app I started with is now fairly old. The examples that Vercel provides have definitely been refined over time. 

I mention this as I've just run through the process of implementing my own functionality to save chats by individual users. This wasn't trivial, and while some elements could use refactoring, I'm largely happy with the way it performs.

Chats are saved using [Vercel KV](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv), the use of which has thankfully been pretty smooth. I'm not a DB guy, so I appreciated the ease of integration.

# Carbon Design System

https://carbondesignsystem.com/

Carbon is IBMâ€™s open source design system for products and digital experiences. With the IBM Design Language as its foundation, the system consists of working code, design tools and resources, human interface guidelines, and a vibrant community of contributors.


## Carbon v React

https://carbondesignsystem.com/developing/react-tutorial/overview

good info about applying the **Grid system**



## Grid

### Using the Grid Component

https://carbondesignsystem.com/developing/react-tutorial/step-2#add-landing-page-grid

The CSS Grid is a 16 column grid. We will specify the span of a `<Column>` using the sm, md, and lg props. For example, `<Column sm={2} md={8} lg={8}/>` means the column will span 2/4 columns at the small breakpoint, 8/8 columns at the medium breakpoint, 8/16 columns at the large breakpoint.


## Breakpoints

I had to hunt for them ... here for reference

```scss
$grid-breakpoints: (
  sm: (
    columns: 4,
    margin: 0,
    width: convert.to-rem(320px),
  ),
  md: (
    columns: 8,
    margin: convert.to-rem(16px),
    width: convert.to-rem(672px),
  ),
  lg: (
    columns: 16,
    margin: convert.to-rem(16px),
    width: convert.to-rem(1056px),
  ),
  xlg: (
    columns: 16,
    margin: convert.to-rem(16px),
    width: convert.to-rem(1312px),
  ),
  max: (
    columns: 16,
    margin: convert.to-rem(24px),
    width: convert.to-rem(1584px),
  ),
) !default;
```


## Carbon Layout

#### Not sure yet if i'm going to use carbon/layout

`@carbon/layout` provides a couple of useful utilities alongside the specification for the grid system for the IBM Design Language. This package includes:
