            a.k.a. Alejandra Ghersi Rodríguez. Having invented her very own

            icons like Björk, Kanye West, ROSALÍA, and Frank Ocean; small wonder

            start in the early 2010s crafting mind-melting club-music mutations
            and then, with 2017’s <i>Arca</i>, stepped up to the mic and laid
            her soul bare in heart-stopping operatic fashion. With 2020’s
            reggaetón-influenced <i>KiCk i</i>, the artist demonstrated her
            mastery of pop, and the following year’s four-volume follow-up saw
