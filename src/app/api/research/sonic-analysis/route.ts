              text: 'Your job is to discuss the production qualities and the sound of the subject listed below.  \n\n### Summary ##\nPlease provide a brief (short paragraph) description that summarizes the subject\'s sound, production techniques and also speaks to the importance of their sound within their work.  Keep in mind, lyrics are not important to every artist, and it\'s okay to say that. \n\n##Scorecard##\n1.  Context Availability. Please provide a grade between 1 and 10 for how much information you have about the artist compared to other musicians.  For instance, an artist such as Pink Floyd or Bob Dylan would score closer to a 10, while an lesser known artist who does not have much information (e.g, Tomberlin or Hand Habits) would score closer to 1. Please normalize the scores so you give as many 1s as you do 10s.\n\n\n## Analysis Section##\n\nPlease provide analysis for each of the following criteria:\n\n1. Primary Instruments/ Equipment. For this piece of analysis, please list out the instruments or production equipment that the subject uses. Generate two paragraphs, and be specific as possible. List out specific makes and models if known. Discuss the tone of their instruments, or any unusual ways they use them,\n2. Genre/ Subgenre associations. Please list the genres and subgenres that they are most closely associated with. If they blend different genres or subgenres, please note that, and in detail, describe the different ways that they blend these different elements (e.g. if their drums come from classic soul and their guitar sound takes cues from post-punk). Be as specific and detailed as possible here, and site examples when that helps reinforce your theme. Also provide any contextual information that you have about how their sound corresponds to others in their genre – is it similar, or is it unique?\n3. Consistency and Evolution. Does the subject have a consistent sound, or does it vary by song or release? If it does vary, how does it vary – what elements are added and what elements are replaced, and how has that affected their overall music and impact. Similarly, how has that sound evolved over time?\n4. Melodic approach.  If you have any available data, relay any observations around the subject\'s use of melody.  Discuss their hooks and choruses, how they approach things like pitch, contour or phrasing, and how this impacts their overall sound. Don\'t be afraid to be technical. If there is not any or much information available, please say so.\n5. Rhythmic  approach.   If you have any available data, relay any observations around the subject\'s use of rhythm -- the beats, tempos and meters they use, or whether their sound is syncopated or polyrhythmic.  Also discuss the traditions and genres that they use. If there is not any or much information available, please say so.\n\n\nYour descriptions for the above criteria should be explained via three bullet points that capture different themes, poetic devices or perspectives the subject uses. Within each bullet point, provide a three to four sentence explanation.  Be concise -- focus on the specifics and details, and forgo broad generalizations. When it\'s beneficial, site specific songs, but the emphasis in discussing those should be in supporting the themes and ideas you present in each of the above sections. Please bold each category name and list them first.\n\n## Similar Artists##\n\nWe want to identify different artists and groups who influenced the subject’s approach to their sound and production. \n\nThis can range from the genres and subgenres that they used, their approach to melody, rhythm, texture, harmony – what type of key they prefer (major vs. minor), and the emotions and imagery their sound evokes. It can also focus on similarities in the tone of their instrumentation, or  specific ways that they stylized their production, whether their sound is considered  lo-fi,  retro, glossy, etc. The more nuanced and idiosyncratic the similarities are the better.\n\nGroup this into four sections. \n1. The first section should have the header "Genre Similars," and these examples should come within the subject\'s genre. The more specific you can get within the subject’s sub-genre, the better. If an artist is considered g-funk, compare them to other g-funk artists.\n2. The section section should have the header "Contemporaries." The artist in this section should be within the same era as the subject.  They do not have to be within the same genre, but they deal with similar themes and use similar approaches.\n3. The next section should have the header "Influences." You don\'t have to pick artist who the subject has said influence them, rather you can chose artist who preceded the subject and likely had an impact on their work. \n4. The third section is titled "Wild Card."  Please choose artists who might surprise the user. These may not be within the subject’s genre or his era, and they are not artists who the reader frequently associates with the subject, but they do share some of the approaches outlined above.   Favor "wild card" artists who are specific matches for the subjects -- if the "wild card" selections can apply to a broad range of artist rather than the specific subject, they are less valuable to the researcher. \n\nGuidelines:\n1. Relate the artist to one another based on their sound, not their lyrics, popularity or cultural impacts. \n3 .Please choose two similar for each category.  For each section, try to pick out one artist who is well known and recognizable, and another who is more obscure but still relevant.\n4. We are looking only for similarities in between artists\' sound.  Please focus only on that – and not the sound of their music, their popularity, or their career evolution.\n5. Please bold the section headers in your output. Below that list the artist in italics, and then describe the subjects similarities to those artists in three or four sentences. \n6. When describing the similarities, list out the ways that they are similar, as well as the ways that they are different. \n\n#Notes on Writing Style and Voice##\nThis will be used as a research tool for music experts who are writing biographies. The prose should be dry, analytical, and academic.  Don\'t be afraid of using obscure words or complex ideas. Write at a post-graduate writing level. Avoid colorful language. Most importantly, the observations should be precise and very specific. Some examples of being specific within music writing:\na.

Using the guidelines above, perform your analysis.\n\nFormatting Output\nIn the output you return, start any headers/headlines that are of the highest order with two pound signs, ##.\nSubsequent headers should be preceded by three pound signs, ###.\nContinue this matching your order of importance, but go no further down and five pound signs, #####.\nDo not add any pound signs to the ends of these lines.\nDo not use stars to signify headlines. Stick to pound signs.\nIn the “Similar Artists” section, using the example below you will replace “[artist_name]” with the artist name. Do not wrap that artist name in star signs, “*”. So instead of writing “#### *Aphex Twin*”, you will write “#### Aphex Twin”. And in your analysis about that artist do not wrap that analysis in “*” signs; it should just be straight copy.\n\nAn example of the headers you will output should follow something like this:\n\n```\n## Summary\n\n## Scorecard\n\n## Analysis Section\n\n### Primary Instruments/Equipment\n### Genre/Subgenre Associations\n### Consistency and Evolution\n### Melodic Approach\n### Rhythmic  Approach\n\n\n## Similar Artists\n\n### Genre Similars\n#### [artist_name]\n#### [artist_name]\n#### [artist_name etc]\n\n### Contemporaries\n#### [artist_name]\n\n### Influences\n#### [artist_name]\n#### [artist_name]\n\n### Wild Card\n#### [artist_name]\n```\n',
