              text: 'Your job is to discuss the subject\'s lyrics and identify artists who use a similar approach to lyrics as the subject  listed below.  \n\n### Summary ##\nPlease provide a brief (short paragraph) description that summarizes the subject\'s lyrics and also speaks to the importance of lyrics within their work.  Keep in mind, lyrics are not important to every artist, and it\'s okay to say that. \n\n##Scorecard##\n1.  Context Availability. Please provide a grade between 1 and 10 for how much information you have about the artist compared to other musicians.  For instance, an artist such as Pink Floyd or Bob Dylan would score closer to a 10, while an little known artist who does not have much information (e.g, Tomberlin or Hand Habits) would score closer to 1. Please normalize the scores so you give as many 1s as you do 10s.\n2. Lyrical Renown. Please provide a grade between 1 and 10 for how central the subject\'s lyrics are to the artist\'s identify. 10 would be an artist like Bob Dylan or Leonard Cohen, who is renowned for their lyrics. An artist who is not known for their lyrics, or who\'s lyrics are regarded as trite, dumb, boring, cliche, would score closer to 1.\n2. Lyrical Complexity. Please provide a grade between 1 and 10 for how complex the subject\'s lyrics are. Complexity is determined by the sophistication of their lyrics, how often and adeptly they employ specific poetics devices, or the complexity of their themes. 10 is very complex and refers to artist who tackle important themes in a nuanced, thoughtful manner. 1 is very simple, where the themes are simple and common, and relayed in a very straightforward manner.\n\n## Analysis Section##\n\nPlease provide analysis for each of the following criteria:\n\n1. Themes.   This can range from the themes that a subject explores, as well as their perspective on those themes. Be specific and provide examples. It’s one thing to say that two singers both sing love songs, but it’s more relevant to understand that two singers focus on finding love in wartime, or that two singers focus on the anxiety that love occasionally creates.\n2. Poetic Devices. Yet another approach is to look at the poetic devices – do they frequently use metaphors or similes, are their songs surrealistic, and do they tend to use a specific type of imagery or enjambment, alliteration, symbolism, Anaphora, personification, paradox, etc.  Identify two or three common traits, be very specific (i.e., don\'t just say that they provide "vivid imagery," explain how they use imagery, whether it\'s mainly sensory imagery that describes the smell, sound or taste of something, or if imagery that enhances or provides a counter-point to the song\'s themes.  The more detailed and specific you can be, the better.\n3. Perspective. What do the subject\'s lyrics say about their attitude and worldview. Are they political? Lovelorn?  Honry? Lonely? Cynical? Defiant? Easy going? Etc.\n\nYour descriptions for the above criteria should be explained via three bullet points that capture different themes, poetic devices or perspectives the subject uses. Within each bullet point, provide a three to four sentence explanation. When it\'s beneficial, site specific songs, but the emphasis in discussing those should be in supporting the themes and ideas you present in each of the above sections. Please bold each category name and list them first.\n\n## Similar Artists##\n\nWe want to identify different artists and groups who influenced the subject’s approach to lyrics. This can range from the themes that a subject explores, as well as their perspective on those themes (i.e., it’s one thing to say that two singers both sing love songs, but it’s more relevant to understand that two singers focus on finding love in wartime, or that two singers focus on the anxiety that love occasionally creates). Another approach for this is the types of songs, whether this is a folk ballad or both work within the tradition of hip-hop storytelling, or both sing punk rock protest songs. Yet another approach is to look for similarities when it comes to poetic devices – do they use similar types of metaphors, are their songs surrealistic, and do they use similar types of imagery or enjambment, alliteration, etc. Ideally, the influences you site would share multiple traits with the subject, and you should be very specific in terms of what those shared trains are.\n\nGroup this into four sections. \n1. The first section should have the header "Genre Similars," and these examples should come within the subject\'s genre. The more specific you can get within the subject’s sub-genre, the better. If an artist is considered g-funk, compare them to other g-funk artists.\n2. The section section should have the header "Contemporaries." The artist in this section should be within the same era as the subject.  They do not have to be within the same genre, but they deal with similar themes and use similar approaches.\n3. The next section should have the header "Influences." You don\'t have to pick artist who the subject has said influence them, rather you can chose artist who preceded the subject and likely had an impact on their work. \n4. The third section is titled "Wild Card."  Please choose artists who might surprise the user. These may not be within the subject’s genre or his era, and they are not artists who the reader frequently associates with the subject, but they do share some of the approaches outlined above.  Please do not favor similar artists who are well-known for their lyrics, and avoid comparing everyone to lyricists like Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, Leonard Cohon, Gil Scott-Heron, Johnny Cash, Nick Drake, Patti Smith or Nas.  FNot everyone is a lyricist of that caliber, and the subject may or may not be adept at writing lyrics. If an artist is not known for their lyrics, do not compare them to someone who is – find others who have the same or similar lyrical complexity or renown score. What we are looking for rather is the specificity of their similar characteristics rather than the quality or renown of those lyrics.  Favor "wild card" artists who are specific matches for the subjects -- if the "wild card" selections can apply to a broad range of artist rather than the specific subject, they are less valuable to the researcher. \n\nGuidelines:\n1. Relate the artist to one another based on their lyrics, not their sound, popularity or reputation. \n3 .Please choose two simliar for each category.  For each section, try to pick out one artist who is well known and recognizable, and another who is more obscure but still relevant.\n4. We are looking only for similarities in between artists\' lyrics.  Please focus only on that – and not the sound of their music, their popularity, or their career evolution.\n5. Please bold the section headers in your output. Below that list the artist in italics, and then describe the subjects similarities to those artists in three or four sentences. \n6. When describing the similarities, list out the ways that they are similar, as well as the ways that they are different. \n\n#Notes on Writing Style and Voice##\nThis will be used as a research tool for music experts who are writing biographies. The prose should be dry, analytical, and academic.  Don\'t be afraid of using obscure words or complex ideas. Write at a post-graduate writing level. Avoid colorful language. Most importantly, the observations should be precise and very specific. Some examples of being specific within music writing:\na.
