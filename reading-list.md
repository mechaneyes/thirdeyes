## Complete Guide to Natural Language Processing

### [Guide to NLP](https://www.deeplearning.ai/resources/natural-language-processing/)

>Recent years have brought a [revolution](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/nlp-models-get-literate/) in the ability of computers to understand human languages, programming languages, and even biological and chemical sequences, such as DNA and protein structures, that resemble language. The latest AI models are unlocking these areas to analyze the meanings of input text and generate meaningful, expressive output.

>Natural language processing (NLP) is the discipline of building machines that can manipulate human language — or data that resembles human language — in the way that it is written, spoken, and organized.

>Hosts Kevin Roose and Casey Newton explore stories from the bleeding edge of tech.

Great podcast in general. Not surprisingly they're focusing on AI a lot these days. They get to sit down with leaders regularly to dig deeper with them.

# Prompt Engineering

## What is Prompt Engineering?

### [DataCamp Article](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/what-is-prompt-engineering-the-future-of-ai-communication)

>At its heart, prompt engineering is akin to teaching a child through questions. Just as a well-phrased question can guide a child's thought process, a well-crafted prompt can steer an AI model, especially a Large Language Model (LLM), towards a specific output. Let’s explore this concept in more detail.


## ChatGPT Personas

### [How to Create ChatGPT Personas for Every Occasion](https://www.howtogeek.com/881659/how-to-create-chatgpt-personas-for-every-occasion/)

>The ChatGPT you get by default has a very professional, curated, friendly tone. It's been carefully tuned by OpenAI to work well for everyone, but that makes it a little bland. Not only that, by default, ChatGPT taps into the full knowledge within the LLM, which can make getting the correct information or behavior from it daunting.

>A ChatGPT persona is a specific personality you ask ChatGPT to take on. Because ChatGPT remembers everything said in a session, you can set the rules for your interaction for that chat thread. That includes specifying what sort of persona ChatGPT should have.
