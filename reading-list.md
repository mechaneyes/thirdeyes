# AI Reading List

*A less than exhaustive list of links to articles surrounding AI.*

The list is an additional sub-list of books to mine for deeper understandings of topics covered. Videos would be good, as well as more podcasts outside Hard Fork which is already below.

Also missing is information about regulation. In addition to copyright being a huge issue, there's a lot to explore concerning how AI is shaping society, what pitfalls are looming and what companies and governments are or should be doing about this.

But this is a living document, so I'll add more items as they're discovered or remembered.

## Complete Guide to Natural Language Processing

### [Guide to NLP](https://www.deeplearning.ai/resources/natural-language-processing/)

>Recent years have brought a [revolution](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/nlp-models-get-literate/) in the ability of computers to understand human languages, programming languages, and even biological and chemical sequences, such as DNA and protein structures, that resemble language. The latest AI models are unlocking these areas to analyze the meanings of input text and generate meaningful, expressive output.

>Natural language processing (NLP) is the discipline of building machines that can manipulate human language — or data that resembles human language — in the way that it is written, spoken, and organized.


## [Short Courses](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/)

While a lot of these courses are geared more toward developers, you can get a lot of high level understanding by browsing what's offered.

# NYTimes

## [Hard Fork Podcast](https://www.nytimes.com/column/hard-fork)

>Hosts Kevin Roose and Casey Newton explore stories from the bleeding edge of tech.

Great podcast in general. Not surprisingly they're focusing on AI a lot these days. They get to sit down with leaders regularly to dig deeper with them.

## [A Conversation With Bing’s Chatbot Left Me Deeply Unsettled](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-microsoft-chatgpt.html)

>A very strange conversation with the chatbot built into Microsoft’s search engine led to it declaring its love for me.

# Stanford HAI

## [AI Index 2023](https://hai.stanford.edu/research/ai-index-2023)

### Measuring trends in Artificial Intelligence

>The annual report **tracks**, **collates**, **distills**, and **visualizes** data relating to artificial intelligence, enabling decision-makers to take meaningful action to advance AI responsibly and ethically with humans in mind.

# Prompt Engineering

## What is Prompt Engineering?

### [DataCamp Article](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/what-is-prompt-engineering-the-future-of-ai-communication)

>At its heart, prompt engineering is akin to teaching a child through questions. Just as a well-phrased question can guide a child's thought process, a well-crafted prompt can steer an AI model, especially a Large Language Model (LLM), towards a specific output. Let’s explore this concept in more detail.


## ChatGPT Personas

### [How to Create ChatGPT Personas for Every Occasion](https://www.howtogeek.com/881659/how-to-create-chatgpt-personas-for-every-occasion/)

>The ChatGPT you get by default has a very professional, curated, friendly tone. It's been carefully tuned by OpenAI to work well for everyone, but that makes it a little bland. Not only that, by default, ChatGPT taps into the full knowledge within the LLM, which can make getting the correct information or behavior from it daunting.
>
>A ChatGPT persona is a specific personality you ask ChatGPT to take on. Because ChatGPT remembers everything said in a session, you can set the rules for your interaction for that chat thread. That includes specifying what sort of persona ChatGPT should have.

# Text-to-Image

## [From the darkroom to generative AI](https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/from-the-darkroom-to-generative-ai)

>In this era of generative AI, how do we determine whether an image is human-created or machine-made? For the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), Professor Hany Farid shares the techniques used for identifying real and synthetic images — including analyzing shadows, reflections, vanishing points, environmental lighting, and GAN-generated faces. A world-renowned expert in the field of misinformation, disinformation, and digital forensics as well as an advisor to the CAI, Professor Farid explores the limits of these techniques and their part in a larger ecosystem needed to regain trust in the visual record.



## Bruce Sterling on the Art of Text-to-Image Generative AI

### [Notes and Video on WinterWerk](https://winterwerk.one/posts/bruce-sterling-on-the-art-of-text-to-image-generative-ai)

My notes from a lecture Bruce Sterling gave last year. Provides a good overview from the perspective of a technologist and design critic.
